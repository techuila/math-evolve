# AGENTS.md — Multi-Agent Collaboration Guide

This document defines how AI assistants collaborate effectively in your codebase.

## Goals

- Eliminate confusion about paths, environment, and contracts
- Use each agent's strengths where they shine
- Provide repeatable handoffs and validation gates
- Maintain transparent collaboration for users

## Roles & Strengths

### Primary Orchestrator (Claude Code)

- Architecture and requirements analysis
- Endpoint discovery and contract mapping
- Security and privacy review
- Refactor planning and design
- Risk assessment and validation
- Complex reasoning and debugging

### Implementation Specialist (Codex/GPT)

- Focused implementation
- Surgical edits aligned with style
- Test generation
- Lint and type fixes
- Small migrations
- Keeping changes minimal

### Code Generation (Aider)

- Large-scale file modifications
- Pattern-based transformations
- Repository-wide updates
- Boilerplate generation

## Collaboration Visibility

### Announcement Format

When delegating between agents:

```
🤝 Working with [Agent] on: [task description]
   Reason: [why this agent is suited for this]
   Expected outcome: [what will be delivered]
```

### Progress Tracking

During collaboration:

- `🔄 [Agent] implementing...` - Work in progress
- `✅ [Agent] completed: [summary]` - Task done
- `🔍 Reviewing output...` - Validation phase
- `⚠️ Adjusting: [issue]` - Corrections needed

## Handoff Template

Use this template when delegating tasks between agents:

```yaml
task:
  description: 'Brief task description'
  agent: 'target-agent-name'

context:
  environment: 'development|staging|production'
  constraints: ['list', 'of', 'constraints']
  dependencies: ['required', 'services']

files:
  modify: ['path/to/file1.ts', 'path/to/file2.py']
  create: ['path/to/newfile.ts']
  delete: ['path/to/obsolete.ts']

contracts:
  endpoints:
    - method: 'POST'
      path: '/api/resource'
      request: '{ field: type }'
      response: '{ field: type }'

plan:
  - step: 'First action'
    acceptance: 'What success looks like'
  - step: 'Second action'
    acceptance: 'What success looks like'

validation:
  commands:
    - 'npm test'
    - 'npm run lint'
  expected: 'All tests passing, no lint errors'

sandbox:
  filesystem: 'read-only|workspace-write|full-access'
  network: 'restricted|approved|full'
  approval: 'always|on-failure|never'
```

## Example Handoff

```
🤝 Working with Codex on: JWT refresh token implementation
   Reason: Standard API endpoint following established patterns
   Expected outcome: Endpoint, service method, and tests

task:
  description: "Add refresh token endpoint"
  agent: "codex"

context:
  environment: "development"
  constraints: ["FastAPI patterns", "80% test coverage"]

files:
  modify:
    - "api/routers/auth.py"
    - "core/services/auth_service.py"
  create:
    - "tests/test_auth_refresh.py"

contracts:
  endpoints:
    - method: "POST"
      path: "/api/auth/refresh"
      request: "{ refresh_token: string }"
      response: "{ access_token: string, expires_in: number }"

plan:
  - step: "Implement service method"
    acceptance: "Validates token, generates new access token"
  - step: "Add router endpoint"
    acceptance: "Follows FastAPI patterns, proper error handling"
  - step: "Write tests"
    acceptance: "Unit and integration tests, 80%+ coverage"

validation:
  commands:
    - "pytest tests/test_auth_refresh.py"
    - "npm run lint"
  expected: "All tests pass, no lint errors"

```

## Collaboration Workflows

### 1. Sequential Pipeline

Most common for feature implementation:

```
Claude → Codex → Claude → User
Design → Build → Review → Deliver
```

### 2. Parallel Divide & Conquer

For independent components:

```
     Claude → [Business Logic]
    ↙      ↘
User         → Merge → User
    ↘      ↗
     Codex → [UI/Tests/Docs]
```

### 3. Consensus for Risky Changes

For critical modifications:

```
Claude + Codex → Design Options → Select Best → Implement → Review
```

### 4. Debug Team

For complex issues:

```
Claude: Root cause analysis
  ↓
Codex: Implement fix
  ↓
Claude: Validate security
  ↓
Codex: Add regression tests
```

## Path Discipline

### Project Structure

```yaml
# Define your project structure
paths:
  source: './src' # Main source code
  tests: './tests' # Test files
  docs: './docs' # Documentation
  config: './config' # Configuration files

# Container paths if using Docker
container:
  app: '/app'
  data: '/data'
  logs: '/var/log/app'
```

### Path References in Handoffs

Always use consistent path references:

- Relative from project root: `./src/components/Button.tsx`
- Absolute when needed: `/app/src/components/Button.tsx`
- Include both host and container paths for Docker projects

## Validation Gates

### Common Commands

```bash
# Testing
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e           # End-to-end tests
npm run coverage           # Test coverage report

# Code Quality
npm run lint               # Lint code
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix lint issues
npm run format             # Format code
npm run typecheck          # Type checking

# Build & Deploy
npm run build              # Production build
npm run dev                # Development server
npm run preview            # Preview production build
```

### Success Criteria

Before marking task complete:

- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Linting clean
- ✅ Type checks pass
- ✅ Coverage meets minimum (e.g., 80%)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Performance acceptable

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do's

- ✅ Use real API endpoints
- ✅ Follow existing patterns
- ✅ Maintain test coverage
- ✅ Document complex logic
- ✅ Validate before handoff
- ✅ Keep changes minimal
- ✅ Preserve code style

### Don'ts

- ❌ Mock data when APIs exist
- ❌ Skip tests "for now"
- ❌ Ignore lint warnings
- ❌ Break existing features
- ❌ Change API contracts without approval
- ❌ Hardcode environment values
- ❌ Hide errors with try/catch

## Agent-Specific Notes

### Codex CLI Mode Specifics

**Default Configuration:**

- Filesystem: `workspace-write` (can modify project files)
- Network: Restricted (requires approval for npm install, etc.)
- Approvals: `on-request` (prompts for destructive operations)

**How Codex Operates:**

- **Preambles**: Shows brief description before each tool use
- **Plans**: Maintains visible step list for multi-step tasks
- **Reading**: Processes ~250 lines per chunk, uses `rg` for search
- **Editing**: Applies minimal diffs via `apply_patch`
- **Commits**: No auto-commits/branches unless explicitly requested
- **Validation**: Runs tests in non-interactive mode proactively

**Requires Approval For:**

- Destructive operations (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`)
- Network operations (`npm install`, `pip install`)
- Docker commands
- Writing outside workspace

### MCP Server Integration

When available, MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide direct integration:

```yaml
# MCP server configuration example
mcp_servers:
  codex:
    capabilities: ['code', 'test', 'docs']
    sandbox: 'workspace-write'
    approval_policy: 'on-request'

  playwright:
    capabilities: ['browser', 'e2e']
    sandbox: 'read-only'
```

**Testing MCP Availability**: Run a simple echo command to verify MCP servers are accessible in your environment.

### Tool Integration Patterns

```yaml
# Define tool capabilities for each assistant
assistants:
  claude:
    capabilities: ['architecture', 'debugging', 'review']
    tools: ['read', 'write', 'search', 'test']

  gpt4:
    capabilities: ['implementation', 'docs', 'refactor']
    tools: ['code_generation', 'test_generation']

  copilot:
    capabilities: ['autocomplete', 'suggestions']
    tools: ['inline_completion']
```

### CLI Bridge Pattern

For projects with CLI tools:

```bash
# Use project CLI wrapper for consistent operations
./project-cli command --option
# Or use MCP servers when available for direct integration
```

## Quality Metrics

Track these across collaborations:

- **Coverage**: Maintain minimum (80%+)
- **Complexity**: Keep functions simple
- **Duplication**: DRY principle
- **Dependencies**: Minimize and audit
- **Performance**: Profile critical paths
- **Security**: No exposed secrets/vulnerabilities

## Continuous Improvement

### After Each Collaboration

1. What worked well?
2. What could improve?
3. Were handoffs clear?
4. Did validation catch issues?
5. Update templates based on learnings

### Template Evolution

This is a living document. Update it with:

- New patterns that work
- Common pitfalls discovered
- Better handoff formats
