# MATHEVOLVE - Project Overview

## Project Name
**MATHEVOLVE**

## Core Intent
A web-based learning tool designed to strengthen Grade 10 students' understanding of Mathematics 10 curriculum.

## Purpose
- Provide interactive learning materials for Grade 10 Mathematics
- Facilitate research evaluation comparing pre-test vs post-test scores
- Measure learning effectiveness within controlled study parameters

## Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: Grade 10 students (ages 15-16)
- **Study Site**: Don Pablo Lorenzo Memorial High School
- **Study Participants**: 60 Grade 10 students
- **Administrators**: Teachers/Researchers conducting the study

## Content Coverage

### Topics Included
1. **Algebra** - Core algebraic concepts and operations
2. **Patterns & Sequences** - Identifying and working with mathematical patterns
3. **Arithmetic Sequence** - Understanding and solving arithmetic progressions
4. **Geometric Sequence** - Understanding and solving geometric progressions
5. **Problem-Solving Sequences** - Applied sequence problems
6. **Polynomial Division** - Techniques for dividing polynomials
7. **Mathematical Theorems**:
   - Remainder Theorem
   - Factor Theorem
   - Rational Root Theorem

### Content Types
1. **Formulas** - Reference materials for mathematical formulas
2. **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides for learning concepts
3. **Quizzes/Tests** - Assessment tools for measuring understanding
   - Pre-tests (baseline assessment)
   - Post-tests (learning outcome assessment)

## Research Methodology

### Evaluation Approach
- **Comparison**: Pre-test vs Post-test scores
- **Objective**: Determine if there is a significant difference in student performance
- **Method**: Statistical analysis of score improvements

### Scope & Limitations
**What We Measure**:
- Pre-test scores (baseline)
- Post-test scores (after using MATHEVOLVE)
- Score differences and statistical significance

**Controlled Parameters**:
- Study time allocation
- Question difficulty levels
- Learning environment

**What We Don't Measure**:
- Unrelated variables outside study parameters
- Long-term retention (beyond study period)
- External factors (home study, tutoring, etc.)

## Privacy & Data Handling

### Student Data Policy
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only collect data necessary for research
- **Pseudonymous IDs**: Use student IDs instead of names by default
- **Privacy-Conscious**: Avoid collecting unnecessary personal information
- **Data Purpose**: Exclusively for research evaluation

### Authentication Approach
- **Minimal Authentication**: Simple admin/teacher login
- **Student Access**: Pseudonymous student ID-based access
- **No Personal Accounts**: Students don't need to create personal accounts

## MVP Scope

### Must-Have Features
1. **Content Delivery System**
   - Display formulas, tutorials, and step-by-step guides
   - Organize content by topic

2. **Assessment System**
   - Pre-test administration
   - Post-test administration
   - Basic quiz functionality

3. **Data Collection**
   - Record test scores
   - Associate scores with pseudonymous student IDs
   - Store timestamp data

4. **Admin Interface**
   - Teacher/researcher login
   - View aggregated results
   - Export data for analysis

### Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
- Progress tracking
- Interactive exercises
- Gamification elements
- Detailed analytics dashboard

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- System handles 60+ concurrent users
- Data is accurately recorded and retrievable
- Export functionality works reliably

### Research Success
- Successfully collect pre-test and post-test data
- Enable statistical comparison of results
- Provide evidence for learning effectiveness

## Project Principles

1. **Keep It Simple**: Prefer maintainable solutions over complex architecture
2. **Complete but Minimal**: Build only what's needed for the research
3. **Privacy First**: Protect student data and minimize collection
4. **Research-Focused**: Every feature should serve the research objective
5. **Implementable**: Stay within realistic scope for completion

## Timeline Considerations
- Must be ready for deployment at Don Pablo Lorenzo Memorial High School
- Must support full research cycle (pre-test → learning period → post-test)
- Must allow time for data analysis after post-test
